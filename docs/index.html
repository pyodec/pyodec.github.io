                    Welcome to Pyodec. This is the reference to the library of
                    core resources and techniques within the package.
                </p>
                <h1>Getting Started</h1>
                <p class="lead">
                    How to hit the ground running with pyodec. 
                </p>
                
                
                <h2>Installation</h2>
                <p>Download a distribution, or clone a version of the repo from Github, and 
                    execute the setup script in the traditional fashion.
                </p>
                <pre><code>$ python setup.py install</code></pre>
                <p>Append <code>--user</code> to install the package only for the local user.</p>
                <p>This is for Linux/Unix installations, and will make <code>pyodec</code> available
                    for import in locally run python executables. To <b>update</b>, simply
                    download a newer version of the code, (ie a new release) and execute
                    the update script as well with the same command.
                </p>
                <p>Pyodec may be added to <code>pypi</code> some day, but at this time
                    it must be installed manually</p>
                    
                    
                    
                <h3>Dependencies</h3>
                <p>
                    The basic modules of pyodec currently require only Python 2.7 or greater
                    (this library is not currently written in python 3), and NumPy. 
                    However, certain decoders may leverage other libraries, particularly
                    certain types of binary file decoders. Those dependencies will be
                    exposed when importing/executing the specific decoder module.
                </p>

                <h2>Decoding with Pyodec</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    Pyodec offers two ways to access the <code>decode</code> method
                    for any specific file decoder. One is based on the core
                    library, where you pass the name of the decoder to use, and the 
                    <code>decode</code> method is returned. Alternatively you can
                    utilize the strucutre of the Pyodec package, and directly import
                    the decoder module, to access its <code>decode</code> method.
                </p>
                <h3>Accessing the decoder</h3>
                <p>
                    Pyodec is structured where decoders are stored in a 
                    module called <code>files</code>. To access a decoder, say
                    <code>vaisalaCl31msg2</code>, you could directly access it with
                    
                    
                </p>
                <pre><code>import pyodec.files.vaisalaCl31msg2 as decoder
>>> data = decoder.decode(src)</code></pre>
                <p>
                    so the <code>decode</code> method is an available method within
                    the named decoder module. This decoder, in return, is an instantiated
                    member of the decoder class contained within the module, which inherits the 
                    core <code>FileDecoder</code> methods, along with some decoder
                    metadata.
                </p>
                <p>Every properly constructed decoder will have a <code>decoder</code> attribute, which
                    is executable. There are several other variables within a decoder
                    module, one of which being the decoder's class, but you will have to
                    look at the docs for that specific decoder to work with those, as their names
                    are not fixed.
                </p>
                <h4>Using simple decoder access</h4>
                <p>
                    Another way to access a decoder is to import and call 
                    <code>pydec.decode</code>, which is a compressed function
                    which will load and exectue the decoder you want, when passed as a
                    string argument. Passing a decoder is required for this method.
                    Here is an example of using it to decode <code>src</code> as above.
                </p>
                <pre><code>import pyodec
>>> pyodec.decode(src, decoder='vaisalaCl31msg2')</code></pre>
                <p>
                    This slightly simplifies the importing process, but to customize
                    how your code uses a decoder, it is necessary to
                </p>
                <h3>Running a decoder</h3>
                <p>
                    There are two ways to decode, first, can decode as a procedural
                    process, where an entire file or dataset is decoded, and the 
                    output is returned. Alternatively you can run the decoder
                    as a generator, (assuming the returned data can be grouped in
                    some fashion), where you can control how many values are returned
                    per iteration. 
                </p>
                <h4>Iterative decoding</h4>
                <p>
                    Assuming your data file will produce groups of data (like 
                    such as a collection of obseravations), a decoder can run
                    in a while loop, as a generator, returning a list of sets
                    every N sets (N defaults to 1000)
                </p>
                <pre><code>for data in pyodec.decode(src, 'decoderName', limit=1000):
    # do something with decoded collection of data points</code></pre>    
                <p>
                    The decode method will recognize that it is being called in a loop,
                    and will yield data at points, instead of the entire data file.
                    When a data file is finished, and there are &lt; N sets int the 
                    dataset, they are yielded, so no data are missed.
                </p>
                <h4>Sequential decoding</h4>
                <p>
                    Alternatively you can decode an entire file at once, which
                    is simpler, and for data files which are not broken into 
                    discrete observations, is the equivalent behavior to the iterative
                    process.
                   
               </p>
               <pre><code>data = pyodec.decode(src, 'decoderName')</code></pre>
               <p class="lead">
                   And that is how you use pyodec, should you have an existing decoder
                   available for your data file (and how you use it once you have built
                   a decoder for your file)
               </p>
               <h3>Building a decoder</h3>
               <p>
                   Well, this isn't really a "getting started" scenario, unfortunately. 
                   Read further down in the docs for the guide on developing a decoder.
