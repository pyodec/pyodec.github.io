              <h1>About Pyodec</h1>
            </div>
            <p class="lead">
                It is a simple idea: Decoding raw data and log files from instruments
                and providers can be a pain. Why not consolidate efforts between
                data users, and only have to write a certain decoder once.
            </p>
            <p>
              
              Created to enable consistent decoding of data log files from meteorological
              instruments, the <b>Pyodec</b> package is able to reduce duplication
              of efforts when trying to decode obscure, proprietary or otherwise 
              unstructured data files. Using Pyodec, a researcher can both check
              if there is already a reliable tool for decoding a certain obscure
              data file, and if not, provide such a tool to the wider science community.
          </p>
          <div class="alert alert-info">
              Pyodec will convert any known input data format
              into a numpy recarray, either representing the entire file, or 
              representing a slice of the file, when run as a generator.
            </div>

          <p>
              Pyodec can, and is, used for decoding structured and binary files as well. 
              By creating a decoder, certain structured files can be even easier
              to read, simply by having a decoder which produces a sorted recarray
              from a CSV. Similarly, binary formats such as netCDF, which are very 
              easy to read on their own, can be completely dumped to recarray objects,
              if that is deemed to be of utility. These decoders should use standard
              python structured file libraries, such as NumPy, scipy, pytables, etc. 
          </p>
          <div class="well">
              <h3><i class="fa fa-certificate" style="color:#090"></i> Goals of Pyodec</h3>
              <p class="lead">We want Pyodec to be <u>accurate</u>, <u>diverse</u>, and <u>fast</u>, in that order.</p>
              <p class="lead">This library is useless if it produces innaccurate or incomplete
                  decodings of input files. Nobody can use it if it does not
                  have a broad ability to decode complex file types. Finally, speed is
                  important to users, but not nearly as accuracy and diversity. 
              </p>
          </div>
          
          <h1 id="save"><i class="fa fa-clock-o" style="color:#090"></i> Save time</h1>
          <p class="lead">
              I think we say this a few times here, but by not having to write 
              and decode all the obscure data formats you work with, you can 
              proceed to analysis much faster.
          </p>
          <p>
              This is more than simply using decoders someone else made for you,
              it also means you can write decoders faster, and only write them once.
              Share them and improve them, and help your research community work faster.
          </p>
          
          <h1 id="better"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" style="color:#090"></i> Decode better</h1>
          <p class="lead">
              When you decode file after file, you will probably skip some data. 
              When there are several of you writing a single decoder, there is time
              to get it right the first time. 
          </p>
          <p>It is incredible what a difference it makes to have every morsel of 
              data contained within a data or log file decoded. It can be the 
              difference between changing an array index in your code, and taking
              an entire day to rewrite your decoder to fetch an overlooked variable.
              It is not because we are lazy, but because we are the opposite: 
              urgently working towards a goal, trying to do as little extra work as possible. 
              </p>
          <h1 id="simplify"><i class="fa fa-flask" style="color:#090"></i> Simplify science</h1>
          <p class="lead">
              Just reiterating here, don't worry as much about decoding your data, 
              worry about using it.
          </p>
          
          <h1><i class="fa fa-users" style="color:#090"></i> Community involvement &amp; contriubtion</h1>
          <p class="lead">
          
              This library truly needs to be written by a community of contributors.
              No single researcher or developer can create decoders for file formats
              they have never had to deal with. 
          </p>
          <p>
              Reserachers should use Pyodec to develop and share their decoders. 
              This package should make decoding files easier in two ways: Providing
              full black-box style file decoding, and providing you some additional
              tools for writing your own file decoders.
          </p>
          <h3>Developing the core library</h3>
          <p>
              Though the decoder library of Pyodec relies on community development,
              the core toolkits and classes are also in need of continuous improvement.
              The core library holds the resources researchers can use to simplify their
              decoders, and could always use more.
              
          </p>
          <h3>This website &amp; documentation</h3>
          <p>
              Documentation is never given enough time, so, naturally it could benefit
              from community attention.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-center" style="font-weight:500;color:#090;margin:80px;">
              Thank you very much for taking this time to check out Pyodec.
